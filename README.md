<h1># Information & Cyber Security Lab Assignments - Semester 5</h1>

Welcome to the **Information & Cyber Security Lab Assignments** repository for my 5th semester. This repository contains the implementations of various cryptographic algorithms as part of the lab exercises for the **Information & Cyber Security** course. The repository will be continuously updated with new assignments as the semester progresses.

<h3>## Overview</h3>

This repository is dedicated to the lab assignments for the Information & Cyber Security course, focusing on the implementation of various cryptographic algorithms. Each cipher is implemented in a separate directory, containing code, related resources, and documentation.

<h3>## Ciphers Implemented</h3>

<h4>### 1. Caesar Cipher</h4>

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

<h4>### 2. Feistel Cipher</h4>

The **Feistel Cipher** is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers. It splits the data block into two halves and processes them through multiple rounds of processing, applying functions like permutation and substitution.

<h4>### 3. Simplified AES (S-AES)</h4>

**S-AES** (Simplified AES) is a reduced-round version of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It is a block cipher with a simplified structure designed to help students understand the core principles behind AES.

<h4>### 4. RSA Cipher</h4>

The **RSA Cipher** is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. It involves two keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

<h3>## How to Use</h3>

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsc111/ICS_lab_experiments.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired cipher directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <cipher-directory>
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file inside each cipher directory to run the code.**

<h3>## Future Updates</h3>

This repository will be updated with additional assignments and new ciphers as the semester progresses. Stay tuned for more implementations and enhancements.
